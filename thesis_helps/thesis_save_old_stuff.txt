\subsection{BAT}\label{sec:cat}
BAT (Bin Annotation Tool) is a classification tool to classify metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). BAT start with predicting open read frames (ORFs) with the help of Prodigal for each MAG. Then, each ORF is queried against the NCBI (non-redundant protein) database with the help of DIAMOND. Each hit then get a score for each ORF, where the best score in the given range is the classification of this ORF. Because each MAG can contain multiple ORFs the hole classification is based on a majority vote for each classified ORF contained in the MAG. It was shown that BAT consistently classified 97\% of the test benchmark to the original publication. It was also observer that BAT either get the same result then the published classification or can be more specific with the resulted lineage. BAT also outperform most other tools since it use a bigger database and also runs with fast and low memory needed algorithm.~\cite{vonMeijenfeldt2019Dec}

\ssubection{Kraken2}\label{sec:kraken}
Kraken2 is a taxonomic classifier, the better version of Kraken with reduce memory usage by 85\%. Kraken2 works on a k-mer based approach for the classification. Each minimizer, of length l where l < k, from the reference sequence library will be stored in a probabilistic, compact hash table to map each of them to the lowest common ancestor (LCA). Now each k-mer will be used to compute their l bp minimizer, which then will be used to calculate the compact hash code. This code then will be used to query the LCA taxon, which will be the classification for this k-mer. To classify the hole metagenomic sequence, Kranken2 use a pruned subtree of the general taxonomy tree, which is based on the taxas ancestors and the k-mer of the sequence. Each node in the three has his one weight equal to the number of k-mers which are associated with it. The beast root-to-leaf path in this tree with the highest sum of weight of the nodes is the classification path of the given sequence, where the leaf will be the  classification of the sequence~\cite{Wood2014Mar,Wood2019Dec}. Kranken2 source code is freely accessible on GitHub~\cite{kraken2_git}.

\subsection{Bracken}\label{sec:bracken}
Bracken (Bayesian Reestimation of Abundance after Classification with KrakEN) is a tool to estimate abundance at the species level or above. Bracken use Kraken raw reads assignment to translate this into  species- or strain-level abundance estimates. With this, we can estimate how much of a species is present by the percentage of reads in the samples. Because Bracken can only compute the abundance, it can not classify the reads to a species. The abundance is calculated by probabilities, where they use Bayesâ€™ theorem to calculate the probabilities of each level in the taxonomic tree~\cite{Lu2017Jan}. Bracken source code is freely accessible on GitHub~\cite{bracken_git}.
