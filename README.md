Welcome to this GitHub repositories

In here i did save work from and for my thesis

In the directory 'jupyternotebooks' there you can find notebooks used for creating different plots for example the boxplots used in my thesis.

In the directory 'Result' there you can find 2 more directory. The first directory 'CAMI_AMBER_result' contain all important result from CAMI AMBER. The second directory 'copied_result_from_the_html', there some result which are not outputted in any way from CAMI AMBER so it was taken from the 'CAMI_AMBER_HTML.html' side to use them to create the boxplots.

The last directory 'thesis_helps' contain a '.txt' file which where old part from my thesis are stored just in case when i need them again.
