# Thesis repository for saving all created result and plots

## Introduction
Welcome to this GitHub repositories

In here i did save work from and for my thesis

In the directory `jupyternotebooks` there you can find notebooks used for creating different plots for example the boxplots used in my thesis.

In the directory `Plots` you can find the plots which where used in the thesis. They come all from the script in `jupyternotebooks`.

In the directory `Result` there you can find 2 more directory. First directory named `CAMI_AMBER_result_cami` contain all result from the cami second challenge which was used to create the plots used in the thesis. The second directory named `CAMI_AMBER_result_own` contain the result of my own workflow which was use to create the plots used in the thesis. NOTE: maybe not all result was used for plotting graphics! Both directory contain a directory with the name `CAMI_AMBER_result` contain all important result from CAMI AMBER. The second directory in both main directory named `copied_result_from_the_html`, contain some result which are not outputted in any way from CAMI AMBER so it was taken from the `CAMI_AMBER_HTML.html` side to use them to create the plots.
