Welcome to this GitHub repositories

In here i did save work from and for my thesis

In the directory 'jupyternotebooks' there you can find notebooks used for creating different plots for example the boxplots used in my thesis.

In the directory 'Result' there you can find 2 more directory. First directory named 'CAMI_AMBER_result_cami' contain all result from the cami second challenge which was used to create the plots used in the thesis. The second directory named 'CAMI_AMBER_result_own' contain the result of my own workflow which was use to create the plots used in the thesis. NOTE: maybe not all result was used for plotting graphics! Both directory contain a directory with the name 'CAMI_AMBER_result' contain all important result from CAMI AMBER. The second directory in both main directory named 'copied_result_from_the_html', contain some result which are not outputted in any way from CAMI AMBER so it was taken from the 'CAMI_AMBER_HTML.html' side to use them to create the plots.

The last directory 'thesis_helps' contain a '.txt' file which where old part from my thesis are stored just in case when i need them again.
